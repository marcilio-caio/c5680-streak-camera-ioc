# StreakCamera Epics IOC

This Input/Output Controller (IOC) implements a StreamDevice EPICS IOC to communicate with the Hamamatsu Streak Camera. It uses WebSocket communication with the RemoteEx Program, which must be open for the system to function correctly.

## Requirements

To run the IOC, ensure the following packages are installed:
* EPICS, version >= R3.15.9
* Streamdevice, version >= 2.8.16

## Running the application 

To run the IOC, follow these steps:
1. *Adjust the Execution Path:* In the `st.cmd` file located in `ioc/iocBoot`, update the execution path to where StreamDevice is installed. For example:
```
#!/opt/epics-R3.15.9/modules/StreamDevice-2.8.16/bin/linux-x86_64/streamApp
```
2. *Set Environment Variables:* In the same st.cmd file, set the IOC and STREAMDEVICE environment variables to point to the root directories of the IOC and StreamDevice module, respectively.
3. *Check IP and Port:* Ensure the IP and port in the `PS1` variable match the computer's IP where the RemoteEx Program is running.
4. *Run the IOC:*
    * Check that RemoteEx Program is opened in the computer which the Streak Camera is connected.
    * Executes the `st.cmd` file to start the IOC.
    * Alternatively, use the `streakcamera-epics-ioc.service` file in the `etc` folder to create and run an application service.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the IOC communicates correctly with the Hamamatsu Streak Camera.

*Notes:*
* All process variables that are indicated with the SP (Setpoint) flag have a respective variable with RB (Readback) termination for reading the values ​​that are configured.

## Example of Use

### Getting FHWM from a captured image

1. With RemoteEx Program opened, open the Streak Camera program:
```
caput SC:App:Start-Cmd 1
```

2. Adjust some parameters associated with the capture:
```
caput SC:GenParams:FocusTimeOver-SP 1
caput SC:GenParams:Mode-SP 1
caput SC:GenParams:TimeRange-SP 4
caput SC:GenParams:BlankingAmp-SP 0
```

3. Start capture in `acquire` mode:
```
caput SC:AcqParams:Start-Cmd 1
```

4. Adjust the contrast:
```
caput SC:Lut:SetAuto-Cmd 1
```

5. Define the region of interest and create:
```
caput SC:ImgParams:RoiIniX-SP 630
caput SC:ImgParams:RoiIniY-SP 0
caput SC:ImgParams:RoiWidthX-SP 150
caput SC:ImgParams:RoiWidthY-SP 1024
caput SC:ImgParams:CreateVerRectRoi-Cmd 1
```

6. Monitor the variable of interest:
```
caget SC:ImgProfile:FHWM-Mon
```
